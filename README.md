# Airfoil-self-noise-prediction

First, we perform the data processing and understand the features used in the dataset.

We used various ML algorithms for Airfoil-self-noise-prediction. For each ML model, we performed Hyperparameter tuning to get the better models and report the better models.

Here are the algorithms used:

1. Linear regression
2. Lasso
3. Ridge
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. Gradient Boosting
7. Support vector
8. KNN
9. XGBoost




Before Hyperparameter tuning, the results are as follows:

Here are the Hyperparameters used for each model we tested
