# Airfoil-self-noise-prediction

First we perform the data processing and understanding the features used in the dataset.

We used various ML algorithms for Airfoil-self-noise-prediction. For each ML model, We performed Hyper parameter tuning to get the better models and report the better model.

Here are the algorithms used:

1. linear Regression.
2. Lasso
3. Ridge
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. Gradient Boosting
7. Support vector
8. KNN
9. XGBoost

Here are the variations of each model we tested

Here are the resulted best models.
